# JavaScript Tutorials For Developers

A collection of articles looking at some of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript in depth. Aimed at developers with experience in one or more other languages who are new to JavaScript, or intermediate JS developers who are already comfortable with beginner level concepts.

Created as a note taking exercise to solidify my own learning, shared in case useful for others!

## How to Read

Click through the links in the Contents section below to view each article. To run code snippets (assuming [you have Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)) enter `node` at the command line and copy and paste snippets to execute, or download the entire file and run by executing `node [pathToFile]`.<br />E.g. `node ./this.js`

## Contents

- [**dataTypes.js**](./dataTypes.js) - covering primitive values vs objects, how they are stored in memory, 'boxing', and whether JavaScript employs pass-by-reference or pass-by-value.
- [**this.js**](./this.js) - examining the different potential bindings of the 'this' keyword.
- [**prototypes.js**](./prototypes.js) - OOP, prototypal inheritance, constructor functions and ES6 class syntax.
- [**closures.js**](./closures.js) - examining the concept of closure and its possible uses including for data encapsulation and memoization.

## References / Source Material

- [**prototypes.js**](./prototypes.js) is almost entirely derived from this excellent video by [Codesmith](www.codesmith.io/) - [JavaScript The Hard Parts: Object Oriented Programming
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAAS9cEuFYI&ab_channel=Codesmith)
- [**closures.js**](./closures.js) is likewise heavily informed by the Codesmith 'Hard Parts' videos [Closures, Scope, and Execution Context
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVXrJ4dnUxM&ab_channel=Codesmith), and [Exploring Recursion in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymkWb5kL34o&ab_channel=Codesmith). <br />[JavaScript Scopes and Closures In-depth](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZ_LyvzfrndUOkIvOF4y-_c&si=gG8FN0Mzj2d3gA2C) from the [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/@Java.Brains) YouTube channel was also helpful.
